# Mission 2-003

General: The goal of this Mission is to practice using simple phrases in VHDL. You should watch the videos and then apply your knowledge by designing the circuits listed using VHDL or by identifying errors in the given VHDL example code. You should test your VHDL code using the testbenches provided, submit .out files in response to coding problems, and numerical responses when asked for line numbers. See the video item "Submitting VHDL Programming Assignments" to learn more about how to do submissions. These 4 problems will be auto-graded upon submission of the answers.

Problem 2: Correct the Code. This assignment is required.  Students must earn at least 70% of the points possible to pass the assignment.

Correct the VHDL code given in the previous problem (also in starter file AAC2M1P3.vhd). You may need to use a conversion function, like to_stdlogicvector() to complete this. Do not try to fix bit orders between vectors a and b.     

To begin, download the starter file AAC2M1P3.vhd, the testbench file AAC2M1P3_tb.vhdp, and vectorh.out from the .zip file located in the reading item "Files for Week 1 Programming Assignments". Finish the code in the starter file. 

After you have completed the design, use Modelsim and the testbench in AAC2M1P3_tb.vhdp to test your code and create an output file with the name myvectorh.out. Your code in file AAC2M1P3.vhd, the input file vectorh.out, and the testbench AAC2M1P3_tb.vhdp must be in the same directory. Use this directory as the source directory for the Modelsim project. Submit your myvectorh.out fileto complete this problem.
